			<h3>
				<p>	
					CoderDojo is a global, volunteer led movement orientated around running free not-for-profit computer<br/> 
					coding clubs and regular sessions for young people. Since CoderDojo is open source all Dojos are<br/> 
					different and completely autonomous! <br/>
				</p>
				<p>
					At our Dojo, young people between ages 9 and 17 learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, <br/>
					games and more. Dojos are set up, run by and taught at by volunteers. In addition to learning to code, <br/>
					members meet like-minded people, show off what theyâ€™ve been working on and so on. CoderDojo makes <br/>
					development and learning to code a fun, sociable, group experience. CoderDojo also puts a strong emphasis <br/>
					on open source and free software, and has a strong network of members and volunteers globally.<br/>
